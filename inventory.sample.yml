# Ceph recommendation is to co-mingle ceph-mgr and ceph-mon, but you
# may deploy ceph-mgr to additional hosts if desired.

# These hosts will have ceph-mon deployed to them.  Esnure that you
# always maintain quorum by using an odd number of ceph-mon such as
# 1, 3, or 5, though there are diminishing returns for using more than
# 5 mons.  Define no more than 5 ceph-mon hosts unless you have a good
# reason to.

# These hosts with have RADOS Gateways (RGW) deployed to them.  Much
# like how we handled ceph-mgr, we should co-mingle with ceph-mon to
# both maintain quorum as well as load balance between the various

# These hosts will run ha-proxy in front of our rgw's.  A single RGW

# better off using ha-proxy to split work up between multiple rgw's.
